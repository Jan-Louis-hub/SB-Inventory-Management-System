# Small Business Inventory Management System
## Frontend, Backend, and Database Task Plan

**Project stack:** React + Vite, Python + Flask, PostgreSQL  
**Project type:** Browser-based web application  
**Initial goal:** Build a reliable inventory system for a small business, starting locally and adding production deployment after the core features work.

---

## 1. Project Goals

The application should let authorized staff:

- View inventory and business activity from a dashboard.
- Create, view, edit, search, filter, and archive products.
- Organize products into categories.
- Record stock receipts, issues, and adjustments.
- Manage suppliers and purchase orders.
- Record sales and automatically deduct stock.
- Review stock movement history and business reports.
- Sign in with appropriate roles and permissions.
- Export useful reports and recover data from backups.

## 2. Suggested Build Order

1. Project setup and configuration
2. Database schema and migrations
3. Product and category API
4. React product management screens
5. Stock movement workflow
6. Supplier and purchase workflow
7. Sales workflow
8. Dashboard and reports
9. Authentication, authorization, and audit history
10. Testing, security review, backups, and deployment

Build and test one vertical slice at a time. For example, complete the database model, Flask endpoints, React screen, and tests for products before moving on to the next module.

## D3. Relationships and Constraints

- [ ] One category can have many products.
- [ ] One sale has many sale items.
- [ ] One product can appear in many sale items.
- [ ] One supplier can have many purchase orders.
- [ ] One purchase order has many purchase order items.
- [ ] One product can have many stock movements.
- [ ] Add foreign keys to preserve referential integrity.
- [ ] Add unique constraints for SKU, email, sale number, and purchase number.
- [ ] Add check constraints for non-negative prices, quantities, and reorder levels.
- [ ] Decide on `ON DELETE` behavior deliberately; preserve historical business records.
- [ ] Use `NUMERIC` for money, not floating-point columns.
- [ ] Use timestamps consistently, preferably storing UTC and converting for display.
- [ ] Decide whether SKU uniqueness is global or scoped to a business.
- [ ] Consider case-insensitive uniqueness for email, SKU, and category names where appropriate.

## D4. Indexes and Query Performance

- [ ] Index foreign key columns used frequently in joins and filters.
- [ ] Index product SKU.
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes for product name search.
- [ ] Index sale date and purchase order date.
- [ ] Index stock movements by product and creation time.
- [ ] Add indexes for commonly used status filters.
- [ ] Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to investigate slow queries when sample data grows.
- [ ] Avoid adding unnecessary indexes before understanding query patterns.

## D5. Data Integrity and Transaction Rules

- [ ] A product quantity must not be changed by sales without a corresponding movement record.
- [ ] Stock deduction, sale creation, sale item creation, and movement creation must commit or roll back together.
- [ ] Receiving purchase order items and increasing stock must commit or roll back together.
- [ ] Protect against duplicate sale submissions.
- [ ] Use suitable row locking or atomic updates for concurrent stock changes.
- [ ] Define how returns, refunds, voids, and cancelled orders affect stock and reports.
- [ ] Choose a consistent approach to stock valuation, such as average cost or FIFO, if financial accuracy requires it.
- [ ] Preserve historical prices and costs on completed transactions.

## D6. Migrations, Seed Data, Backups, and Recovery

- [ ] Create the initial migration.
- [ ] Test applying migrations to a clean database.
- [ ] Test upgrades from an earlier schema.
- [ ] Create optional development seed data for categories, products, and suppliers.
- [ ] Keep test data separate from real business data.
- [ ] Configure regular database backups.
- [ ] Test restoring a backup into a separate database.
- [ ] Document retention, access, and recovery procedures.
- [ ] Plan safe migrations before deploying schema changes.

**Database completion criteria:** The schema enforces key relationships and constraints, transactional workflows preserve stock integrity, and the database can be backed up and restored.

# 6. Cross-Component API Contract

Agree on request and response formats before implementing each feature across all three layers.

| Feature | Frontend responsibility | Backend responsibility | Database responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Products | Forms, table, search, filters | Validation and CRUD endpoints | Product and category records |
| Stock | Movement form and history | Validate and apply movements | Quantity and movement records |
| Purchases | Order creation and receiving UI | Order status and receiving logic | Purchase orders and items |
| Sales | Cart, totals preview, receipt | Validate sale and deduct stock | Sales, items, and movements |
| Dashboard | KPI cards and charts | Aggregate and return metrics | Efficient aggregate queries |
| Reports | Date filters and exports UI | Report generation and authorization | Accurate historical records |
| Authentication | Login and role-aware navigation | Authentication and permissions | Users and role-related data |

Suggested initial API endpoints:

```text
GET    /api/health

GET    /api/products
POST   /api/products
GET    /api/products/<id>
PATCH  /api/products/<id>
POST   /api/products/<id>/archive

GET    /api/categories
POST   /api/categories
PATCH  /api/categories/<id>

GET    /api/stock-movements

GET    /api/suppliers
POST   /api/suppliers
PATCH  /api/suppliers/<id>

GET    /api/purchases

```

The exact endpoints may change as the design evolves. Document any changes so the frontend and backend remain aligned.

# 7. Definition of Done

A task is complete only when:

- [ ] The frontend works in the browser and handles loading, success, empty, and error states.
- [ ] The backend validates inputs and enforces authorization where needed.
- [ ] Database changes are made through migrations.
- [ ] Important business operations are transactional.
- [ ] Tests cover the happy path and important failure cases.
- [ ] No credentials or sensitive data are committed to Git.
- [ ] The feature has been tested with realistic sample data.
- [ ] Any relevant setup or API documentation has been updated.

# 8. First Sprint — Start Here

Complete these tasks in order:

1. [ ] Install Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, and VS Code.
2. [ ] Create the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. [ ] Start the React app using Vite.
4. [ ] Set up a Flask virtual environment and install dependencies.
5. [ ] Create `inventory_db` and configure the database connection.
6. [ ] Add the Flask health endpoint and verify it in a browser.
7. [ ] Create the initial database migration and product model.
8. [ ] Implement `GET /api/products` and `POST /api/products`.
9. [ ] Build the React product table and add-product form.
10. [ ] Verify that a product saves to PostgreSQL and remains after refreshing the browser.
11. [ ] Add tests for duplicate SKUs and invalid product data.
12. [ ] Commit the working milestone to Git.

**First milestone:** A user can open the browser, create a product, see it in the product list, and retrieve it again from PostgreSQL after refreshing the page.
